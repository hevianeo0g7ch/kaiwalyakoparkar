Question :

Given a string s1 and a string s2, write a snippet to say whether s2 is a rotation of s1?

(eg given s1 = ABCD and s2 = CDAB, return true, given s1 = ABCD, and s2 = ACBD , return false)

Answer :

1. Optimal Solution :
    - Create a temp string and store concatenation of str1 to str1 in temp. temp = str1.str1
    - If str2 is a substring of temp then str1 and str2 are rotations of each other.
    - temp = str1.str1 = "ABACDABACD" Since str2 is a substring of temp, str1 and str2 are rotations of each other.
