**Question :**

Given a string S. The task is to print all permutations of a given string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:ABC
Output:ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA
Explanation:Given string ABC has permutations in 6
forms as ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA .
```

**Logic:**

1. Mapping Approach O(n! * n) complexity with O(n) space complexity :
    - A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length n has n! permutation.
    - Below are the permutations of string ABC. ABC ACB BAC BCA CBA CAB
    - Here is a solution that is used as a basis in backtracking.
