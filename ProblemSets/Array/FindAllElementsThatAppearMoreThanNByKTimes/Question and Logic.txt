Question : 
Given an array of size n, find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times. 
```
For example,  
if the input arrays is {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3}and k is 4, 
then the output should be [2, 3]. Note that size of array is 8 (or n = 8), 
```

so we need to find all elements that appear more than 2 (or 8/4) times. There are two elements that appear more than two times, 2 and 3.

Answer : 

Logic : 

1. HashMap Solution :
    - Take the input as a array
    - declare x = n / k and a HashMap of < Integer, Integer >
    - run a loop through the array and check if the element is present in the map
        - If no then put it in the map as (arr [ i ] , 1)
        - If yes then make count = mp.getValue( arr[ i ] ) and then put it in the map as (arr [ i ], count+1)
    - then iterated through the map and if the key for the puricular value is greater than x then print the Key
