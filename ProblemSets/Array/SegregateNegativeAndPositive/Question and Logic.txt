Question: 

An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

**Examples :**

```
Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5
```

**Note:** Order of elements is not important here.

Answer:

Logic: 

1. Sorting : 
    - Take the input as the array
    - sort the array. ( Either inbuilt or self implemented )
    - all the negatives will be seperated from the positives

2. 0 Reference : 
    - Take the input as array
    - Declare two pointers i and j
    - i will move from arr [ 0 ]th location to arr [ arr.length - 1 ]th location. in this it will check if arr [ i ] < 0 and i is not equal to j . if yes, 	      then it will swap arr [ i ] and arr [ j ]
    - if no, then it will simply increment j
    - when both i and j will reach the last position, the loop will stop
    - print the array
