Question :

Given an array, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
5 1 2 3 4
```

Answer:

1. Traditional Approach: 
    - take the input as array and t as no of rotations
    - rotate the loop from 0 to t
    - store the last element in temp and run loop in reverse order till 1st location ( arr [ 1 ] )
    - shift arr [ i ] = arr[ i - 1 ]
    - put temp in arr[ 0 ]
