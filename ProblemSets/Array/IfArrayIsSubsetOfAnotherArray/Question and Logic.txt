Question : 

Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] of size m and arr2[0..n-1] of size n. Task is to check whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both the arrays can be both unsorted or sorted. It may be assumed that elements in both array are distinct.

**Input:**

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an two integers m and n denoting the size of arr1 and arr2 respectively. The following two lines contains the space separated elements of arr1 and arr2 respectively.
**Output:**

Print "Yes"(without quotes) if arr2 is subset of arr1.Print "No"(without quotes) if arr2 is not subset of arr1.

Answer :

1. Brute-Force Approach :
    - Use two loops: The outer loop picks all the elements of arr2[] one by one. The inner loop linearly searches for the element picked by the outer loop. If all elements are found then return 1, else return 0.


2. Hashing function :
    - Create a Hash Table for all the elements of arr1[].
    - Traverse arr2[] and search for each element of arr2[] in the Hash Table. If element is not found then return 0.
    - If all elements are found then return 1.
