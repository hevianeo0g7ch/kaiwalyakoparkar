Given an array Arr that contains N integers (may be positive, negative or zero). Find the product of the maximum product subarray.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2}
Output: 180
Explanation: Subarray with maximum product
is  6, -3, -10 which gives product as 180

Answer : 

1. Using Two nested loops ( Bruteforce approach )
2. Used modified Kadane's algorithm for this question ( optimized)
