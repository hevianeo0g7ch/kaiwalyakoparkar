Question : 

Given an array of **N** integers, and an integer **K**, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to **K**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 4, K = 6
arr[] = {1, 5, 7, 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.
```

Answer : Logic : 

1. Naive approach  :
    - Take input as an array
    - run a nested loop i = 0 to arr.length -2 and j = i+1 to arr.length-1.
    - if arr [ i ] + arr [ j ] == k ( required sum) then increment the counter

2. Optimized approach : 
    - Take a look at the below image and the comments in the code to understand the intution behind the algorithm ( On Notion )
