Question : 

There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)).

```
Input : arr1[] = {1 ,12, 15, 26, 38}
arr2[] = {2, 13, 17, 30, 45}
Output : 16

Explaination : after merging these two arrays the middle elements are 15 and 17 so 
(15+17)/2 so the answer is 16
```

Answer : 

Logic : 

1. Merging and finding :
    - We have an algorithm to merge two arrays we implemented before.
    - here we have to implement the merging algorithm first then
    - we have to add the length of arr1 and length of arr2
    - if the addition "finLen" is even then the middle element and the element before the middle element has to be added "midAdd" and then print the (addition (midAdd) divided by two)
    - and if the addition is odd then you can directly print the middle element
