Question : 

Given a row wise sorted matrix of size RxC where R and C are always odd, find the median of the matrix.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
R = 3, C = 3
M = [[1, 3, 5], 
     [2, 6, 9], 
     [3, 6, 9]]

Output: 5

Explanation:
Sorting matrix elements gives us 
{1,2,3,3,5,6,6,9,9}. Hence, 5 is median.
```

Answer : 

1. Naive Approach O(n*m log(n*m)) :
    - Take the input as a 2D array
    - Traverse the marix same as you take input in the matrix and add the elements to the array of size row * column
    - after successfully adding the elements in the array, sort the array
    - then return the element at resultsArr.length/2 th location
